## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

With our analytics project, we first want to clean up all the data that are present in the database. From there, we want to use the tools at our disposal to understand more about sale trends of videos games in the past. We would like to know what factor or what various factors could have affected a games sale performance. Or if there are any correlation or relationship between sales and the different characteristics of a game such as the platform it is released on, genre, or etc. 
Our interest in the topic arose from Brian and Spandan’s investment in video games. From present video games, to the old school classics on pre-PC platforms, it is a lot of nastalgia to visit while learning about data science. We want to explore to see if any variables are associated with higher sales of a game. If there are any continuous trends that persist in the sale data. Or if there are changes in the trends, we hope to be able to identify it and visualize it. 

We are fairly confidant that we can build a user-facing Dashboard with this dataset. 


What do you hope to do with your analytics project?
- understand more about sale trends of video games 
- various factors that associate with sales such as ranking, platform, genre etc

Why are you interested in this topic or dataset?
- Spandan and Brian are quite the video game enthusiast
- database of past sales is a lot of nastalgia to visit while learning about data 

Do you have any questions you specifically want to explore?
- video game sales are interesting cause you never really know what could be popular and whatnot
- any continuous trends that were persistent or have changed over time

Could you imagine building a user-facing Dashboard with this dataset?
      Note: In the final weeks of the course you will be building a Dashboard with your data so choose wisely
      - I think so

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Who: Which company/agency/organization provided this data?
- GregorySmith a user on kaggle.com that used the vghartzScrape tool on github to generate the database

What: What is in your data?
- it is created 2016 with sale data of diff games in various regions 

When: When was your data collected (for example, for which years)?
- 2016 for the data collection with possibility of having 2019 data that came with the extended db
- the dataset contains data about video game sales from as old as 1980

Why: What is the purpose of your dataset? Is it for transparency/accountability, public interest, fun, learning, etc…
- data tracking, public interest, fun, and learning too

How: How was your data collected? Was it a human collecting the data? Historical records digitized? Server logs?
- data scraped from vghcarts a website about games 

The database of our interest was found posted on Kaggle by GregorySmith, a user on Kaggle, who had generated the database utilizing **[vgchartzScrape](https://github.com/GregorUT/vgchartzScrape)** on the website vgChartz. The data contained is everything about video game sales, with fields included such as: ranking of the over sales, name of the games, platform of which it was released, year of the release, genre, publisher, sales in different regions (NA, EU, JP, others), and total overall global sales. The original database was collected in 2016 which includes data from 1980 up to the date of collection. Subsequently inspired other users to follow suit in creating various other databases that were updated or contained other metrics for analysis. One example, is the linked dataset from 2019 which updates the original database we are using. The database was collected with the purpose of recording video game sales without having a specific purpose it would fulfil. However, it is certainly an interesting topic worthy of investigation. Our data was collected by a user running a data scraper to compile into the database we now have on hand.
