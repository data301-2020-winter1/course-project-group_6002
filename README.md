## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

With our analytics project, we first want to clean up all the data present in the database. From there, to understand more about the sale trends of video games in the past. We would like to know what factors could have affected a game's sales performance. Or if there is any relationship between the sales and the different characteristics of a game such as a platform it is released on, its genre, etc. Our interest in the topic arose from Brian and Spandanâ€™s investment in video games. From present video games to the old school classics on pre-PC platforms, this topic is nostalgic for us. We want to explore and see how different variables are associated with the number of sales of a game. Suppose any continuous trends persist in the sale data, how does it change over time? If there are changes in the directions, we hope to identify it and visualize it.

We are fairly confidant that we can build a user-facing Dashboard with this dataset.

> Could you imagine building a user-facing Dashboard with this dataset?
      Note: In the final weeks of the course you will be building a Dashboard with your data so choose wisely
      - I think so

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The database of our interest was posted on Kaggle by GregorySmith, a user on Kaggle, who had generated the database utilizing **[vgchartzScrape](https://github.com/GregorUT/vgchartzScrape)** on the website vgChartz. The data contained is everything about video game sales, with fields included such as ranking of the over sales, name of the games, platform of which it was released, year of the release, genre, publisher, sales in different regions (NA, EU, JP, others), and total overall global sales. The original database collected in 2016 includes data from 1980 up to the date of collection. Subsequently inspired other users to follow suit in creating various other databases that were updated or contained other metrics for analysis. One example is the linked dataset from 2019, which updates the original database we are using. The database was collected to record video game sales without having a specific purpose it would fulfill. However, it is undoubtedly an interesting topic worthy of investigation. Our data was collected by a user running a data scraper to compile into the database we now have on hand.
